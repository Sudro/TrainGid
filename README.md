# TrainGid
This is a project carried out on the topic: *“Railway information and reference system”*.
It allows you to view tables of trains, stations, routes and fares by connecting to the database. 
You can also perform different actions with each table: adding, changing and deleting data. 
The application contains 2 users: a “user” who can only view the contents of the tables, and an “administrator” who can also perform various actions with the tables. 
The entire application is made with a pleasant, convenient and user-friendly interface.
